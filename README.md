# PesterOperationTest
A collection of Pester test aimed at validating your infrastructure. Think of it like a place where you will find ready made templates for mission critical applications/features/services.

Initial thought is to create a folder for each vendor and then a folder for each app/thingy. Every test script will be published to the Powershell Gallery for easy access.

This is fully driven by the community and myself. If you want to supply code/tests, awesome. If you just want to use it, be my guest!

Pull requests are welcome as well as feedback.
